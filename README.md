# Map Viz Thing
Map visualization for Rich's microshift edge demo at RHDE

## How to run this?
Deploy instructions are part of a bigger Microshift demo and [can be found here](LINKTBD). The short verison is that this webapp will be built in to a OCI container image and then bundled with some other OCI images/configuration as part of the RHEL for Edge OS image (why? to allow it to [support disconnected/offline startup](https://microshift.io/docs/user-documentation/how-tos/offline-containers/#what-are-offline-container-images)).

## Want to build/develop on this
